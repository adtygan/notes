- Internally, it resembles a matrix
- Row size - no. of words , (e.g.) `100`
- Column size - size of each word vector (e.g.) `512`
- Then embedding matrix is of shape `(100, 512)`
- Additionally, this embedding matrix is **trainable**
- You can either start with random weights, or pick a pre-trained embedding matrix and fine-tune it
