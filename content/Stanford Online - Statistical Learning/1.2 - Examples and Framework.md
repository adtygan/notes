- Y -> dep. var. / target
- X -> vector of $p$ predictor measurements / predictors / features
	- $[v_1, v_2, ...., v_p]$
- Unsupervised learning:
	- No $y$
		- So how to find how well we did? This is an active problem
	- Goal is to learn how data is organized
	- Which features are imp. for the organization of the data
	- PCA and clustering
		- Even for supervised setting, use these, find imp. features and use those
